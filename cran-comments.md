This is a patch release implementing the following bug fixes:

* passing nodal_types to `make_model()` now implements correct error handling 
* `query_distribution()` no longer overwrites type distributions internally 
* node naming checks are operational in `make_model()`

This patch release further improves type safety and implements range based
looping throughout the package.
