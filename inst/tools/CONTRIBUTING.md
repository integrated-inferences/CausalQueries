:tada: Welcome to our contribution guidelines and thank you for your interesting in contributing! 

  
  ### Reporting a bug
  Before you report a bug make sure the same bug hasn't been reported before. We track bugs as [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/macartan/gbiqq/issues). 
  If no related issue has been opened, create an issue keeping in mind the following guidelines:
  
  - Use an informative title
  - Write a minimal working example that allow us to reproduce the bug you found
  - If the bug you're reporting crashes your R session, please mention that in the tittle
