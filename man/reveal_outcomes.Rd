\title{Reveal outcomes}
\usage{
reveal_outcomes(model, dos = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model created by \code{make_model}}

\item{dos}{A list of do actions  e.g. \code{list(X = 0, M = 1)}}
}
\value{
revealed_data
}
\description{
Reveal outcomes for all causal types. Calculated by sequentially calculating endogenous variables.
If a do operator is applied to any variable then it takes the given value and all its descendents are generated accordingly.
}
\details{
\code{reveal_outcomes} starts off by creating types (via \code{\link{gbiqq:::get_types}}). It then takes types of endogenous and reveals their outcome based on the value that their parents took. Exogenous variables outcomes correspond to their type.
}
\examples{
model <- make_model("X -> Y")
reveal_outcomes(model)

model <- make_model(add_edges(parent = "X1", children = "Y"),
                   add_edges(parent = "X2", children = "M"),
                   add_edges(parent = "M",  children = "Y"))
reveal_outcomes(model, dos = list(X1= 1, M = 0))

}
