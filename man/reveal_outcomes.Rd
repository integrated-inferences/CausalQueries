\title{Reveal outcomes}
\usage{
reveal_outcomes(model, dos = NULL, node = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A \code{causal_model}. A model object generated by \code{\link{make_model}}.}

\item{dos}{A named \code{list}. Do actions defining node values, e.g., \code{list(X = 0, M = 1)}.}

\item{node}{A character. An optional quoted name of the node whose outcome should be revealed. If specified all values of parents need to be specified via \code{dos}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} object of revealed data for each node (columns) given causal / nodal type (rows) .
}
\description{
Reveal outcomes for all causal types. Calculated by sequentially calculating endogenous nodes.
If a do operator is applied to any node then it takes the given value and all its descendants are generated accordingly.
}
\details{
\code{reveal_outcomes} starts off by creating types (via \code{\link{get_nodal_types}}). It then takes types of endogenous and reveals their outcome based on the value that their parents took. Exogenous nodes outcomes correspond to their type.
}
\examples{
model <- make_model("X -> Y")
reveal_outcomes(model)

model <- make_model("X1->Y;X2->M;M->Y")
reveal_outcomes(model, dos = list(X1 = 1, M = 0))

model <- make_model("X->M->Y")
reveal_outcomes(model, dos = list(M = 1), node = "Y")

}
