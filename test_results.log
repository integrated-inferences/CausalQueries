Model has been updated and contains a posterior distribution with
4 chains, each with iter=2000; warmup=1000; thin=1;  
Use inspect(model, 'stan_summary') to inspect stan summary

Note: Model does not contain the following objects: posterior event_probabilities, stanfit;
to include these objects update model with 'keep_event_probabilities = TRUE', 'keep_fit = TRUE'

Note: To pose causal queries of this model use query_model()
